		<span style="padding: 5px 15px;">I'm nahkd123. I'm a random guy who just programming and... watching memes everyday lol. While everyone is busy at their bussines for just money, I'm here to making free program for everyone. The main reason is because paid program are usually being cracked. So, even if you tried to protect your software, then just stop, and making open source, free software instead. Don't waste your time.</span><br>
		<span style="padding: 5px 15px;">The first programming language (not really) that I've ever tried is Batch. Batch doesn't has anything special, it can't even create something really useful. And then, I stared to making Bukkit plugin. It's just a basic plugin, and then I move to Spigot.</span><br>
		<span style="padding: 5px 15px;">Now those are related to Minecraft, which is the game with tons of young gamers. And they just want to create a epic server, to not just having some fun with their players, but also getting money from them. Idk, but they want to. So they decide to gathering some premium plugin that they've found in BSMC, or Directleaks, in order to make server. Now many people said that this is illegal, and I do accept that. But, paid software made them to use leak, or cracked version of the plugin, instead of pay to author. And this is where I started to mass producing free plugins.</span><br>
		<span style="padding: 5px 15px;">Beside from that, I also make web application. The project that I loves when making it is nahkdAPI Scripting tool. It's interface just look like Scratch, which is good for young server owners to getting stared, using their creativity instead of using leaked stuffs. It's free and open sourced with nahkdAPI plugin. You can check it out at <a href="https://nahkd123.github.io/nahkdAPI/tools/Scripting">Github Page</a></span>

		<span style="padding: 5px 15px;">My next project will be 'How to make Bukkit plugin', where I show all instructions on how to create a simple plugin, but in order to create it, you'll need Java knowleadge. But, if you don't want to learn Java, then just watching online, it's free and for everyone who interested in making Bukkit/Spigot plugin.</span>
