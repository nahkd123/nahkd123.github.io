# About me (@nahkd123)
To save your time, I'll write some info about me in a list form:

- I went by `nahkd` or `nahkd123` on the internet.
- He/him is my pronouns, and I am straight guy.
- I live in Hanoi, Vietnam and my timezone is GMT+7:00 a.k.a VST (Vietnam Standard Time).
- Main skill is programming.
- Auxiliary skills are pretty disappointing.

# What I do
I love doing random things. Most of the time, I would do some programming, but sometimes I draw stuffs (mostly characters, rarely objects).

I wish I know how to make music as well, but the music making softwares are either expensive, or free but having weird UX, which are reasons why I tried to make Mixery! I also wanted to try modeling stuffs or sculpting something in Blender, but it seems like it is a steep learning curve.

What else? I don't know really, but if the stuff leans towards the creative side then I would like to try. Programming will ended up being boring when you do it long enough, so I'd love to try to improve other skills other than writing JavaScript code at 3AM.

# How did I got into programming?
Short answer: Minecraft.

Yep. A silly block game made by Mojang is the reason why I do programming. It sounds stupid but it is also understandable at the same time. Stupid because "why would a game got me into programming?", and understandable because of ability to do some modding.

Nowadays kids would learn programming by making like, idk, Roblox games? Which is fine I guess but they are missing out on the joy of modding a silly little block game. Or it's just me finding the joy after all, who knows? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

# All about my programming skills
## Web stack
- Modern JavaScript + TypeScript
- Modern web technologies
- Basic HTML5
- Average CSS + SCSS
- Basic Vue.js (used in [the new Mixery](https://github.com/MixeryOSS/mixery))

### Modern JavaScript
I use modern JavaScript features like `class` and `async/await`, which are 2 normal stuffs that I expect every JS developers out there already know.

### Modern web technologies
I can use modern web technologies like [Streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API), [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), WebAssembly or whatever tech out there. I'm not sure if anyone care about these, as most webapps still requires internet access, while these techs are designed for PWA and offline usages (well, at least in Vietnam).

From my observation, people don't care too much about offline usage on webapps. But in a country where poeple rarely spend money on mobile data, offline usage still worth looking into. And this might be even more true in places that can't access the public internet. I don't know really, it could be just me wanting to provide offline access to people.

Recently, I tried using WebGPU to see if I can make something cool with it without using frameworks like Babylon.js.

## Server-side
- Average Node.js

I don't do backend much. Most of the time, I use Node.js to automate my builds instead of running web application with it. It is safe to say that backend is not my thing, though I can just write backend if I have to. People will ended up becoming full stack web developers anyways.

## Java
- Up to language features in Java 17
- **I don't use Spring Framework**

The main reason why I don't include Java under [Server-side](#server-side) section is because I don't use Java for server-side web stuffs (duh). Which means I don't use Spring Framework (which is what people would expect you to know when you said that you know Java).

Most of the time, I use Java for something related to Minecraft, mainly because the game was written in Java and I want my Minecraft-related tools to behave as expected, or when I am making mods/plugins for it. The other time I use Java because I am experienced with it, really.

I usually design my Java libraries around modern language features, like lambda expression or records for example. I also rarely use reflection in modern Java, simply because I don't see the need to do that (not because it is slow btw).

## Other
### The Web3 boom
Blockchain, decentralization, Solidity, etc... Those are funny words that you would hear from typical cryptobro (except they really don't know what the heck are those). To be fair, if they don't destroy the tech by putting money on literally everything, I would have been Web3 developer. But I guess the greed is big enough to kick me out of the bubble.

Don't get me wrong, but the blockchain tech is great at avoid tampering. It even used in Minecraft chat report system! But the greedy people have destroyed it to the point where everytime you hear something related to Web3, you just want to click the "Block" button as fast as possible.

Do I have some skills in Web3? Yes, but not much really. I tried Solidity and to be honest with you, the concept is really interesting. Pair it with zero-knowledge proof tech and you got Dark Forest game!

Despite all positive praises, I still want to **warn** you not to enter this sector, as it is filled with greeds and money. Just having a centralized server is enough for your small applications, but when big money is involved, you might want to consider this option.

# Non-programming skills
## Drawing
- Inkscape (vector graphics)
- Krita (or whatever raster art program out there haha yes)

You might think that programmers don't do creative stuffs, but let me tell you: programming can get boring real quick. And what do I do when I am bored after 12 hours of programming? Drawing! (or playing games, but we don't talk about this yet).

I wouldn't call myself an artist (and I would never call myself a professional artist), because I am not good at drawing. I usually get perspective or proportion wrong, plus my coloring is... meh.

I love going for smooth-cel style. I would use smooth shading when there is little changes in depth, and cel shading if there is a significant changes or I am coloring the outline. I mainly use basic brushes in Krita to do the coloring, but I would love to use a custom brush to speed things up.

**Did you know:** Even with the generative AI boom, I still love drawing everything by hand. Those that said "people gatekeeping others from becoming artist" will never experience the joy of drawing with pen and paper (ok fine I don't use paper but let's just pretend I do). Now that doesn't mean I also rioting against AI; it's just that people are abusing it way too much.

## UI design
I can do some UI design in Figma, though the designs might not be professional, because I didn't go through the training. I mostly design the UI based on how I want it to looks like and how I want to use it. For example, I would use `margin: 0 4px` on labels because they look more appealing to my eyes.

## I want to learn these!
- [ ] Music production
- [ ] 3D Modeling and sculpting (in Blender)
- [ ] Caligraphy with 漢字 (Hán Tự/Hanzi/Kanji)
- [ ] Voice acting! (preferably e-girl because I want free Discord Nitro haha yes)
- _All cool hidden stuffs out there..._

### Caligraphy
Why I want to learn the hardest skill to master? Because I love suffering with hard life goals (well, not really).

Think about it: caligraphy requires more than just putting down your brush and making some strokes. You need to control your brush height, when to make smooth or sharp turning angles, stroke speed or whatever out there. But once you managed to write a nice looking character, it will be awesome. It's just that I've never got to experience it yet.

### "Voice... acting? Why do you want to VC e-girl?"
Listen, I want to get free Discord Nitro, which is why I want to learn how to do voice acting (for fun, mostly). I know just how down bad average Discord moderators are, and I think you know it too.

And if I don't get free nitro, this skill is still useful as I can still use it to troll my friends, become vocalist, or pass it though AI for free e-girl quotes/ASMR generator (oh my god I am so good at coming up with money-making ideas). I'm still identifying myself as straight guy after all, don't worry.

"use voicemod" - nahh, voicemod is for the weak.

# Gaming
If my GitHub profile is not obvious enough, then I want to tell you that I do play Minecraft. If you ask me to give opinions then I would say "11/10, would buy this for my kids (if I ever have one)". If this block game inspires you to pursue programming, then don't forget to tell everyone that you love the game.

I also play osu!. I think I shouldn't say more about this.
